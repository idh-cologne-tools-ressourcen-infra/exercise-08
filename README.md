## Step 1

Please clone this repository onto your local computer. On the command line, you would enter: `git clone https://github.com/idh-cologne-tools-ressourcen-infra/exercise-08`, and create a new branch using your UzK username as a name.

## Step 2

Open the directory in Eclipse (or your favorite development tool for Java), and inspect available classes. The main method in the class `Document` creates a document representation of an example sentence with tokens.

## Step 3

Change the `Token` class such that it also able to store information from a 
dependency parse. Add code to the main method so that each token *also* gets dependency information. Verify that the methods `getGovernor()` and `getRelation()` in `Token` also return the correct result.
